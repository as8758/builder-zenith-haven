# GitHub Pages Deployment Status & Action Plan

## ‚úÖ Current Situation (Status + To-Do)

### Status:
- **Repository**: `builder-zenith-haven` is on GitHub at https://github.com/as8758/builder-zenith-haven
- **GitHub Pages**: Enabled with Branch `main` and source folder `/docs`
- **Custom Domain**: `www.adhels.com` is connected via a CNAME file in the root of the repo
- **DNS Configuration**: `adhels.com` points to GitHub's A records + CNAME for www is correct
- **Pages Deployment**: Shows Active and Deployed
- **Issue**: Visiting https://adhels.com or https://www.adhels.com shows blank page or 404

---

## ‚ùå What's Probably Wrong:
- The raw `index.html` still references `/client/App.tsx` directly
- The site has not been built using Vite or the build output is not in `/docs`
- The `vite.config.ts` may not have the correct base path for GitHub Pages (`/builder-zenith-haven/`)

---

## üîß What Must Be Done:

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Vite Base Path
Confirm that `vite.config.ts` includes:
```typescript
base: '/builder-zenith-haven/',
```

### 3. Build the Site
```bash
npm run build
```
This generates a `dist/` folder.

### 4. Prepare for GitHub Pages
```bash
# Rename dist/ to docs/ so GitHub Pages can serve it
mv dist docs
```

### 5. Deploy to GitHub
```bash
git add docs
git commit -m "Add built static site for GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

### 6. Verify CNAME File
Make sure the CNAME file at the repo root contains:
```
www.adhels.com
```

### 7. Confirm GitHub Pages Settings
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages
- Source: Branch `main`, Folder `/docs`

---

## üöÄ Expected Result

After these steps, the site will be deployed correctly at:
- **Primary**: https://www.adhels.com
- **Redirect**: https://adhels.com (will redirect to www)

## üìù Important Notes for AI or Developers:

### Technical Details:
- ‚û°Ô∏è **Project Type**: Vite + TypeScript project
- ‚û°Ô∏è **Critical**: Won't work if raw `.tsx` files are served ‚Äî they must be built to static HTML, CSS, JS
- ‚û°Ô∏è **Base Path**: Must match the GitHub repo name to fix broken asset paths
- ‚û°Ô∏è **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components

### Portfolio Features:
- Black and orange color scheme
- Professional data analyst & AI developer portfolio
- Responsive design with animations
- CV download functionality
- Work experience timeline
- Certifications and achievements section
- Academic recommendations
- Contact form

## ‚è±Ô∏è Next Steps:

### Immediate Actions:
1. ‚úÖ Run the deployment steps above
2. ‚úÖ Wait 1‚Äì5 minutes for GitHub Pages to update
3. ‚úÖ Test https://www.adhels.com ‚Äî should show the built site, not blank

### Verification Checklist:
- [ ] Dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- [ ] Vite config has correct base path
- [ ] Site built successfully (`npm run build`)
- [ ] `docs/` folder created and pushed to GitHub
- [ ] CNAME file is correct
- [ ] GitHub Pages settings configured
- [ ] Site loads at www.adhels.com with SSL

---

## üéØ Final Deliverable

**A working GitHub Pages site under the custom domain: www.adhels.com with correct SSL certificate.**

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If the site still doesn't work after following these steps:

1. **Check GitHub Pages Status**: Go to repo Settings ‚Üí Pages to see if there are any errors
2. **Verify Build Output**: Ensure the `docs/` folder contains `index.html` and asset files
3. **DNS Propagation**: DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to fully propagate
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Try opening the site in an incognito/private window
5. **Check Console Errors**: Open browser developer tools to see any JavaScript errors
